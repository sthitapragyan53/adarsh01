        "Solids have a definite mass, volume, and shape due to short intermolecular distances and strong forces. Unlike liquids or gases, the constituent particles have fixed positions and only vibrate about their mean positions."

      content:
        "Crystalline solids (True Solids) have long-range order and sharp melting points. They are Anisotropic (properties change with direction). Amorphous solids (Pseudo-solids) have short-range order and melt over a range of temperatures."

        "Crystalline solids are divided into four types: 1. Molecular (held by Van der Waals forces), 2. Ionic (Coulombic forces, e.g., NaCl), 3. Metallic (sea of electrons), and 4. Covalent/Network (strong covalent bonds, e.g., Diamond)."

      content:
        "The density ($d$) of a unit cell is calculated using the formula: $d = (Z \times M) / (a^3 \times N_A)$, where $Z$ is the number of atoms per unit cell, $M$ is molar mass, $a$ is edge length, and $N_A$ is Avogadro's constant."
